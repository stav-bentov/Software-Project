# K-means Algorithm in C and Python

## Description
Given a set of N datapoints x1, x2, . . . , xN ∈ Rd, group the data into K ∈ N clusters, each datapoint is assigned 
to exactly one cluster and the number of clusters K is such that 1 < K < N. 
Implementation of this algorithm in both Python and C.
